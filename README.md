# JammingUp
This is a game I made together with my friend [(link to his linked-in profile)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrzejgolski/),  in order to participate in [Mini Game Jam 136](https://itch.io/jam/mini-jam-136-cycles)
The game was made in Unity. 

## About the game
Playing with sound is recommended

Traverse 16x16 grid, while cyclying trough states of your shape!

Movement - WSAD or arrow keys (or controller I think)

Change emotion (color) - SPACE

How to play:

- Each game you are given different order of emotions that you can cycle trough - indicated in top left corner
- You can only move to the tile when your shape is the same color.
- You can enter white tile whenever
- You get 1 point for entering new tile
- You get more points if you enter on diferently colored tile each time, building up combo
- You get 10 points for collecting a coin
- Collecting certain amount of coins helps you in game by reducing map speed or granting bonus map reshuffle. Go get them!
- The grid moves down with increasing speed you lose if you are at the bottom when grid moves, keep going up!
